## Features
- **Event Management**: Create, activate, and deactivate events with configurable rewards and duration.
- **Attendance Tracking**: Record check-in and check-out times for event attendees.
- **Reward Distribution**: Calculate and distribute base and bonus rewards based on attendance duration.
- **Verifiers Management**: Assign verifiers to validate attendance.
- **Treasury Management**: Handle STX deposits and withdrawals to fund rewards.

## Installation & Setup
1. Deploy the smart contract using the Clarity smart contract deployment tools on a Stacks blockchain testnet or mainnet.
2. Set the contract owner as the principal deploying the contract.
3. Ensure the contract treasury is funded by calling the `deposit-funds` function.

## Error Codes
The contract defines several error codes to handle edge cases and ensure robust operations:
- `ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED (100)`: Caller lacks permission to perform the action.
- `ERR-ALREADY-CLAIMED (101)`: Reward already claimed by attendee.
- `ERR-EVENT-NOT-ENDED (102)`: Attempt to claim reward before event end.
- `ERR-EVENT-ENDED (103)`: Event has already ended or is inactive.
- `ERR-NO-REWARD (104)`: No valid reward available.
- `ERR-EVENT-NOT-FOUND (105)`: Event ID does not exist.
- `ERR-INSUFFICIENT-FUNDS (106)`: Insufficient funds in the treasury.
- `ERR-INVALID-DURATION (107)`: Invalid event duration specified.
- `ERR-ALREADY-REGISTERED (108)`: User already registered for the event.
- `ERR-INVALID-START-HEIGHT (110)`: Event start height is invalid.
- `ERR-INVALID-REWARD (111)`: Reward value exceeds allowed limits.
- `ERR-INVALID-MIN-ATTENDANCE (112)`: Minimum attendance exceeds event duration.
- `ERR-ALREADY-VERIFIED (122)`: Attendance already verified.
- `ERR-EVENT-NOT-ACTIVE (120)`: The event is no longer active.
- `ERR-INVALID-AMOUNT (1005)`: Invalid amount specified for deposits/withdrawals.

## Usage
- **Creating Events**: Use the `create-event` function to create events with rewards and attendance requirements.
- **Registering Attendance**: Attendees check in and check out via the `check-in` and `check-out` functions.
